        "\n",
        "So far you have explored what regression is with sample data gathered from the pumpkin pricing dataset that we will use throughout this lesson. You have also visualized it using `ggplot2`.💪\n",
        "\n",
        "Now you are ready to dive deeper into regression for ML. In this lesson, you will learn more about two types of regression: *basic linear regression* and *polynomial regression*, along with some of the math underlying these techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Throughout this curriculum, we assume minimal knowledge of math, and seek to make it accessible for students coming from other fields, so watch for notes, 🧮 callouts, diagrams, and other learning tools to aid in comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "As a reminder, you are loading this data so as to ask questions of it.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   When is the best time to buy pumpkins?\n",
        "\n",
        "-   What price can I expect of a case of miniature pumpkins?\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Should I buy them in half-bushel baskets or by the 1 1/9 bushel box? Let's keep digging into this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous lesson, you created a `tibble` (a modern reimagining of the data frame) and populated it with part of the original dataset, standardizing the pricing by the bushel. By doing that, however, you were only able to gather about 400 data points and only for the fall months. Maybe we can get a little more detail about the nature of the data by cleaning it more? We'll see... 🕵️‍♀️\n",
        "\n",
        "For this task, we'll require the following packages:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `tidyverse`: The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a [collection of R packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed to makes data science faster, easier and more fun!\n",

        "-   `tidymodels`: The [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework is a [collection of packages](https://www.tidymodels.org/packages/) for modeling and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `janitor`: The [janitor package](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor) provides simple little tools for examining and cleaning dirty data.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   `corrplot`: The [corrplot package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corrplot/vignettes/corrplot-intro.html) provides a visual exploratory tool on correlation matrix that supports automatic variable reordering to help detect hidden patterns among variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can have them installed as:\n",

As such, the line of best fit is the line that gives us the lowest value for the sum of the squared errors - hence the name *least squares regression*.\n",
